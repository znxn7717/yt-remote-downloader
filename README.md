## ⚙️ Option 2: GitHub Actions (Fork Required)

You can run a manual workflow in GitHub and download the result directly from **Artifacts**.

### Workflow file

`.github/workflows/download-from-url.yml`

### How to run

1. Create a **fork** first and work from your fork.
2. Open your repository on GitHub.
3. Go to the **Actions** tab.
4. Select **Download from URL**.
5. Click **Run workflow**.
6. Fill in:
   - `url` (required): the video/page URL you want to download
   - `format` (optional): yt-dlp format selector (default is `b`)
7. Click **Run workflow** to start.

### How to download the result

1. Open the completed workflow run
2. Scroll to **Artifacts**
3. Download `downloaded-file-<run_number>`
4. Extract the zip to get your downloaded file(s)

### Notes

- Cookies are optional. Many public videos will download without cookies.
- Some videos (age-restricted/private/rate-limited) may require cookies.
- If you see `Sign in to confirm you're not a bot`, add cookies secret and re-run.
- For shared usage, each user should run from their own fork and keep their own cookies secret (see [Add your own cookies safely (optional)](#add-your-own-cookies-safely-optional)).
- Files are uploaded from the `downloads/` folder.
- Artifact retention is set to 7 days.

### Add your own cookies safely (optional)

1. In GitHub, open **Settings** -> **Secrets and variables** -> **Actions**
2. Click **New repository secret**
3. Use one of these names:
   - `YTDLP_COOKIES`: paste full `cookies.txt` content (Netscape format)
   - `YTDLP_COOKIES_B64`: paste base64 of the same `cookies.txt` content
4. Save

The workflow will automatically use these secrets if they exist (`YTDLP_COOKIES_B64` is preferred when both exist).
